# OctoprintMonitor

This is a wireless and portable 3D Printer monitor based on the Octoprint API. It uses an OLED display to show the current state of the 3D Printer, as well as the battery.
The OctoprintMonitor.py is the script that gets the information from the 3D Printer through the octoprint API, and the service called octoprintmonitor.service allows to run the script during boot time.
